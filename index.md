## About Me

I am a first year CS Ph.D student at the Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah, where I am currently advised by Prof. Pratik Soni. Before starting my Ph.D, I was a Research Associate at the Cryptography and Information Security (CrIS) Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru under Prof. Arpita Patra. Prior to that, I worked as a Software Developer at Amazon for 2.5 years. I completed my B.E. in CS from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in 2022.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in cryptography and theoretical computer science. My current research is primarily focused on secure multi party computation (MPC) and zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). As an RA at IISc, I worked on implementing MPC protocols for problems related to privacy preserving machine learning and secure graph computation.
